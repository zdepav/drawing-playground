# Drawing Playground

A simple app for writing short scripts in JavaScript (and maybe other languages in the future),
that will have access to multiple drawing APIs (System.Drawing from .NET, CanvasRenderingContext2D from JavaScript).

The purpose of this app is to have a simple way to experiment with these APIs,
in the future it may be possible to create small JavaScript-based desktop games using this app.

The project is currently not finished (and therefore not functional).
